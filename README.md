# MazeRunner
By Jackson Xiao and Shirley Jin
A multiplayer board game that replicates a maze.

Objective:
The objective of the game is to maneuver through a maze and reach the finish line before your opponent.  
On the gameboard there are ‘X’s that represent walls, ‘E’s that represent empty blocks,
an ‘F’ that represents the finish line, and ‘J’s that give you the ability to jump on walls. During each 
round, a player can move north, east, south, west, northwest, northeast, southwest, or southeast. 
A player can only move one spot per turn.
